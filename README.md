Gilded Rose Kata in Ruby
========================

The objective of this kata is to practice refactoring. This kata motivates the need for refactoring as follows:

* The implementation is spaghetti code, and difficult to glean context.
* The tests of the current implementation pass, but there are a number of pending tests.
* You are asked to implement the code to get the pending tests to pass.
* This isn't easy, because the implementation is so messy.
* Consider using the passing tests to refactor the code to make it more habitable before implementing new functionality.
Also known as a [preparatory refactoring](http://martinfowler.com/articles/workflowsOfRefactoring/#preparatory).

## Good solutions
* Refactor the existing code to be in a clean and understandable structure (feel free to create additional files)
* The code should be easily understandable
* All tests shoult be passing (including the pending ones)
* Be creative and have fun. Show us your coding style (how does good code look like for you?)
* Try to have small and descriptive commits

## Where to Start

* Make a copy of this repository (no forks please)
* Begin refactoring the existing `lib/gilded_rose.rb` class.
* Make the pending tests pass
* Send us the link to the solution

## Original Requirements

Here are the [requirements](https://github.com/jimweirich/gilded_rose_kata#original-description-of-the-gilded-rose)
as given in the original version of the kata. It may help you to understand the problem domain if you know
that the [Gilded Rose](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Gilded_Rose) is an inn from the World of Warcraft.
